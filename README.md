This project aims to leverage advanced deep learning techniques for accurate identification and classification of various types of brain tumors, thereby facilitating timely evaluation by medical professionals.

1. Through the exploration of image augmentation methods, we aimed to enhance model accuracy and generalize its performance by mitigating overfitting issues commonly encountered in conventional approaches. <br>
2. The employed augmentation strategies yielded promising results, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.8%. Furthermore, we investigated the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques using pre-trained models such as ResNet50 and VGG19.<br>
3. By leveraging these established architectures, we observed substantial improvements, achieving accuracies of 97% and 95% respectively. Notably, this approach led to significant reduction in trainable parameters, consequently reducing the computational resources (CPU, GPU) utilization and training time. <br>
4. Moreover, the utilization of fewer trainable parameters allowed for training on smaller datasets, which is particularly advantageous in the context of healthcare data, known for its scarcity and expense. <be>

Overall, our findings demonstrate the efficacy of employing advanced deep learning techniques in medical image analysis, offering both improved accuracy and cost-efficiency.
